## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Neeraj — a full-stack web developer focused on building scalable, production-grade web applications.

I specialize in modern web architecture using:

- ⚡ Next.js (App Router)
- 🔐 Secure Authentication systems
- 🗄️ Database design (SQL & NoSQL)
- 🤖 AI integrations
- 🏗️ Clean backend architecture
- 🌍 Deployment & production readiness

I approach development with a **system design mindset**, not just feature implementation.
